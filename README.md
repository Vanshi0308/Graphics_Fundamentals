# Graphics Fundamentals

#### By Vanshika Sinha

This project was aimed at recreating Minard's visualization of Napolean's Russian Campaign using graphical programming. The visualization shows the position of cities and path of army through them, survivors in the army along the path and the temperature during retreat. 

The visualisation has been constructed using the Minard-data file and the data consists of 3 parts:

* City locations and names
* Temperature variation with dates and longitude
* Number of soldiers and their direction of travel along Napoleanâ€™s campaign

## Tools Used

The tools used are libraries in the python language. The libraries are Pandas for ingesting data from the excel and altair for creating the visualisation.
